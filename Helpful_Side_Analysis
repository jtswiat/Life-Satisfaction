Two supplemental table are useful for any analysis of the data:

1. A table containing the listed column name of the data as well as it's more descriptive meaning.
2. A table illustrating of what special values in different columns mean.

For 1. The Python file `codebook_to_column_meaning.ipynb` reads in `codebook_long.txt	`, a file describing each variable which includes how it is recorded in the data table (usually of for vXXX) as well as the more descriptive meaning of it. The file outputs `column_name_meaning.csv` which is a 2 column table with the vXXX column label as well as the descriptive name.

For 2. The table `missing_value_meaning.csv`	satisfied 2., and was created by manually inspecting `codebook_long.txt`. It describes what special values `.a`, `.b`, `.c` and `.d` mean for different variables. An example of this:

- For `v67`: Mothers's highest level of education, special values `.a`, `.b`, `.c` correspond to Refusal, Don't Know, No Answer
- For `v68`: Partner's highest level of education, special values `.a`, `.b`, `.c`, `.d` correspond to Not Applicable,Refusal, Don't Know, No Answer

It is valuable to know the meaning of these values for interpreting the impact of them on the response varaible.
