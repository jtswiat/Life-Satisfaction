# Life-Satisfaction

The goal of this project is to explore the relation between various aspects of someones life and how happy they are. 
The file train.csv contains information on 30081 survey respondents from different European countries. 

This project has two components, prediciton and presentation. For the prediction component, the goal is to best predect the outcome of the target survey question. The question was worded: “Are you very satisfied with your life overall?”. This takes two values : 1 (yes), 0 (no). Our goal is to predict whether respondents are very satisfied with their lives overall based on their other survey responses.

For the presentation component, the main goal is to be understandable. The goal is to communicate our approach to prediction for the this data and and pass on insight that have gained.
